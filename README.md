This repository will held all the exercise given during the course [UBCx: SPD1x How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UC3Mx+IT.1.1x+3T2015). Which is a Java Language Learning course provided by [**_eDX_**](www.edx.org). I am just taking for testing my skill and review some of the important aspects of the language.
